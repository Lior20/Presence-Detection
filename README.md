   - Automatic file rotation
   - Customizable frame settings

3. **Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Center cropping
   - RGB565 conversion
   - MobileNet inference
   - Real-time processing

## Setup and Configuration ⚙️

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect the ArduCAM to your TI microcontroller:
   - SPI pins for data transfer
   - I2C pins for camera control
   - CS pin for chip select
   - Power and ground connections

### Software Configuration
1. Configure the camera settings:
   ```c
   #define CENTER_CROP (1)
   #define RGB565_CONV (1)
   #define NUM_ROW     (240)
   #define NUM_COLS    (640)
   ```

2. Set up image processing parameters:
   ```c
   #define NUM_CROP_ROW (8)
   #define NUM_CROP_COL (96)
   #define EFF_COLS     (224)
   ```

## Usage 🚀

### Initialization
```c
// Initialize system components
Board_init();
GPIO_init();
SPI_init();
I2C_init();

// Initialize ArduCAM
Arducam_init();
```

### Image Capture
```c
// Start image capture
Arducam_start_capture();

// Wait for image ready
while (!Arducam_image_ready()) {
    // Wait for capture completion
}

// Read and process image
Arducam_read_image();
```

## Debug Output 🐛
The system provides debugging information through UART with a baud rate of 115200. This includes:
- Camera initialization status
- Image capture events
- Processing pipeline status
- Error messages

## Performance Considerations ⚡
- Image processing is performed in real-time
- Thread priorities are configured for optimal performance
- Memory management uses efficient buffer handling
- Power management features are implemented for better efficiency

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues
1. SPI Communication Errors
   - Check CS pin configuration
   - Verify SPI clock rate
   - Ensure proper power supply

2. Camera Initialization Failures
   - Verify I2C connections
